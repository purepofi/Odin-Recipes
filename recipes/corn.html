        <h1>Air Fryer Corn Ribs</h1>
        <img src="../images/corn.jpg" alt="curled and seasoned corn ribs">
        <p>This is a fun take on air-fried elote ribs. Cutting the 
            this way cuases them to curl up in the shape of ribs once cooked</p>
        <p>This also makes the corn a lot easier to handle and eat, not to mention
            a lot less messy too.</p>

        <li>Place an ear of corn on a cutting board and cut in half lengthwise. Cut 
            each half in half lengthwise. Repeat with remaining ear of corn. You should have 8 "ribs" total.</li>

            ribs and top with cotija cheese and cilantro.</li>
